# Heart Disease Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. This project aims to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on medical attributes using machine learning techniques.

The model analyzes patient health data and provides a binary prediction:
- **1** → Presence of heart disease  
- **0** → No heart disease  

---

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains medical attributes commonly associated with heart disease.

**Typical features include:**
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type (cp)
- Resting blood pressure (trestbps)
- Cholesterol level (chol)
- Fasting blood sugar (fbs)
- Resting ECG results (restecg)
- Maximum heart rate achieved (thalach)
- Exercise-induced angina (exang)
- ST depression (oldpeak)
- Slope of ST segment (slope)
- Number of major vessels (ca)
- Thalassemia (thal)

**Target Variable:**
- `target` (0 = No heart disease, 1 = Heart disease)
